**David P. Judge** is a Computer Scientist who has taught Bioinformatics since 1985. He initiated the University of Cambridge Bioinformatics Training Facility, providing the necessary environment for graduate and undergraduate courses. 

He has also been involved with training programmes at the European Bioinformatics Institute, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC) through GTPB. He currently teaches Bioinformatics in several international training programmes and is regularly invited to teach in many places in Europe, Asia, Africa and America.

His course notes and exercises are well known to the international community of Bioinformatics professionals and users, many of whom (difficult to count) have had their first contact with Bioinformatics through him. David Judge helped to pioneer Bioinformatics Training at the IGC in 1989, as part of an MSc course. Since its inception in 1999, he has contributed to the GTPB several times per year.

## Pedro Fernandes
**Affiliation:** Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência, Oeiras, PT

  <img src="./Images/Instructors/Pedro_F.jpg" height="220" width="170" align="left" style="margin-right: 3%; margin-bottom: 0.3em;">

**Pedro Fernandes** graduated in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering at IST (U.T. Lisboa). He worked in Biomedical Engineering, Biophysics and Physiology and changed to Bioinformatics in 1990. 

He established the first user community in Portugal around the national service provided by the IGC as the Portuguese node of EMBnet. In 1998 he created the Gulbenkian Training Programme in Bioinformatics, that provided user skills to more than 5150 course attendees throughout its nineteen years of existence. In 2002, in cooperation with Mario Silva from FCUL, he designed a graduate Programme in Bioinformatics. He currently teaches Bioinformatics both in graduate and undergraduate programmes. 

Pedro Fernandes is the Training Coordinator of Elixir-PT, now superimposed with Biodata.PT, the national infrastructure for bio-medical data resources. He also represents IGC in GOBLET, the Global Organisation for Bioinformatics Learning, Education and Training.

## Daniel Sobral
**Affiliation:** Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência, Oeiras, PT

   <img src="./Images/Instructors/Daniel_Sobral.jpg" height="220" width="170" align="left" style="margin-right: 3%; margin-bottom: 0.3em;">

**Daniel Sobral** graduated in Informatics Engineering from Instituto Superior Técnico (Lisbon, Portugal). His interest in Biology led him to join the Gulbenkian PhD programme, and conduct his doctoral studies in Bioinformatics at the Université Aix-Marseille (France) with Dr. Patrick Lemaire. 

During his PhD he worked in different aspects of bioinformatics, particularly focusing on gene expression networks underlying embryonic development of a model organism, all of this integrated into a community resource. Later he became a Developer for the Ensembl Project where he worked mostly in integrating epigenetic data from the ENCODE project in Ensembl. In this context, he gained significant experience with high throughput sequencing data. 

In 2012 he moved back to Portugal, where he joined the Bioinformatics Unit at the IGC to assist the local research community in handling the sequencing revolution brought about by high throughput technologies. Within this role he has been collaborating in several projects, ranging from genomics, transcriptomics and epigenetics. He has become the Head of the Bioinformatics Unit at IGC since 2014.
