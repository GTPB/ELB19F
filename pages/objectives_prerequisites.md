# Learning Objectives

The operation of the various programs used in the exercises will be explained, but only to the extent that allows a user to select parameters intelligently and to interpret results.

The course will provide participants with an awareness of a wide range of bioinformatics tools and sufficient experience to use those tools in basic investigations with a relatively high degree of user independence.

In the training course design, this is intentionally built-in, to allow us to show a wide range of analytical techniques while providing enough experience to break the ice in all of them.

# Course Pre-requisites

A baseline level of the understanding of the central dogma of biology is required.

Recommended Linux and basic Unix command line skills, such as navigating in a directory tree and copy files will be helpful. See, for example, ["Session 1" of the Software Carpentry training for a Unix introduction](http://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/shell-novice/).
